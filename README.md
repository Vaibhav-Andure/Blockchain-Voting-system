# Blockchain-Based Online Voting System

## Overview
The Blockchain-Based Online Voting System is an innovative approach to digital democracy that leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. By utilizing a decentralized ledger, votes are recorded in an immutable and verifiable manner, significantly reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation. This system promotes voter anonymity while maintaining the integrity of the electoral process, enhancing trust among voters.

## Why This Project?
Current voting systems, such as ballot box voting and electronic voting, face various security threats, including DDoS attacks, vote alteration, and malware attacks. These issues create distrust in existing systems. By using blockchain technology, the voting process can be made more secure, transparent, and reliable.
